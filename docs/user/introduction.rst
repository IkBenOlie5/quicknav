Introduction
============

This will walk you through what quicknav is and some of what it can do.

What is Quicknav
----------------

Quicknav is a command line tool that allows you to easily jump to specific locations in your
filesystem from a simple command. Quicknav is built for terminal navigation on Unix operating systems.

Why Quicknav
------------

Quicknav allows you to easily set shortcuts to locations in your filesystem. It is made to speed up
your terminal navigation to commonly accessed places without cluttering your terminal with aliases.

Basic Examples
--------------

.. code:: bash

    # easily navigate to shortcuts that were set in the config
    $ nav rs     # go to rust projects folder
    $ nav py     # go to python projects folder
    $ nav js     # go to javascript projects folder
